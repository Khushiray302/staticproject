        <h2>This is a white cat. They might be little, but the Munchkin brings us massive joy! According to PetMD, this small cat made a resurgence in the 1980s after two were discovered under a pickup truck in Louisiana. Named after the characters in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Munchkinâ€™s short legs are their most notable feature and may even allow them to perch upright like a prairie dog. When fully grown, they stay between 4 and 9 pounds, maintaining their kitten-like appearance into adulthood. There is certainly no place like home, especially with this furry friend by your side.</h2>
